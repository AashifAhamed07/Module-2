# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a=16
result=bin(a)
print(result)
```

## Output
<img width="321" height="161" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-20 200519" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/503e4249-b820-448d-9e15-f47ca630c981" />

## Result
Thus, the python program to convert a number to binary representation using built-in functions is executed successfully
